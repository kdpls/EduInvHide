A PocketMine-MP 4 plugin to hide Education Edition items and blocks from creative inventory.

**FUN FACT!** This plugin was made during a massive internet connectivity interruption with my ISP.

## How does it work?

When the plugin is being enabled, the plugin unregisters all items and blocks that are instance of `Element` and `ChemistryTable`, as well as the `ELEMENT_ZERO` (named as `???`) block from the creative inventory.
